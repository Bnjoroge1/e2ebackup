**End-to-end encrypted backup, using an TEE system such
as AWS Nitro enclaves.**


**TEE:**
Secure Processing: Ensuring that the preparation of data for backup (such as compression and deduplication) is performed in a secure manner, protecting the integrity of the data.
User Authentication: Managing secure user authentication processes to authorize backup and restore operations, ensuring that sensitive operations can only be initiated by authorized users.
Secure Communication: Establishing secure channels for transmitting backup data between the client and the backup server, ensuring that data is encrypted and integrity-protected in transit.
Access Control and Policy Enforcement: Enforcing security policies and access controls for the backup and restore operations within the secure environment provided by the TEE.
**AWS Nitro Enclaves:**
**HSM:(Hardware security model)**
	Key Generation: Securely generating strong encryption keys that will be used to encrypt the backup data before it is stored.
Key Storage: Safely storing the encryption keys, ensuring that they are resistant to extraction even if an attacker gains physical access to the HSM.
Key Management: Handling the lifecycle of keys, including rotation, expiration, and revocation, to maintain the security of the backup data over time.
Encryption and Decryption: Performing cryptographic operations securely within the HSM, thereby minimizing the risk of key exposure.
